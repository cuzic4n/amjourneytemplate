This script is a default scripted decision node template that you can paste into a scripted decision node and it will by default print out sharedState, transientState, secureState

There are constructs like a self-invoking function that you should use. Thus, use this template and delete the rest.

There are examples of how to interact with these "states" so you have some quick examples.

The end goal is that this will become the default template from a journey scripted decision node.
